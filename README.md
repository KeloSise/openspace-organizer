# Open Space Organiser

This is my first Project as part of the BeCode AI and Data Science 7 month bootcamp. The objective is to consolidate our learning of Python concepts from basics as lists, to more advanced concepts like classes, file handling, and exception handling. 

## Project requirements
 We were given the following guidelines:

Your company moved to a new office with an open space having 6 tables of 4 seats each.

Many of you are new colleagues, so you come up with the idea to change seats every day to get to know each other better while working alongside your new colleagues.

You will create a Python script that runs each day to reassign everybody to a new seat.

**Must-have features**
The program allows you to (i) get a list of colleagues from an Excel file, and (ii) place them randomly at the different tables of the open space.
The default setup of the open space is 6 tables of 4 seats â†’ 24 seats
The program takes a filepath as an argument to load the list of colleagues
The program distributes at random the people on the existing tables and says how many seats are left
The program can gracefully deal with the possibility of having too many people in the room
The program has functionality to display the repartition at any given point:
The number of people in the room
The number of available seats in the room
The number of seats that are left

### Installation
The project is available as Python code. You can open it in any IDE such as VS Code to run the program. For the time being, there is no interactivity with the user so you can run it by running the python script in the terminal or simply running the main.py code block with your IDE.


### Timeline

This project was completed in January 2024, over 2 days in Brussels. The coding was split between my home officce in Schaerbeek and the BeCode offices at BeCentral in Brussels centre.
